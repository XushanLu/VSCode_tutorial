    "Bayes' theorem tells us how to understand the probability of a given event, given that other events have occurred.  Our book gives a very nice derivation of Bayes' theorem that we will go through here. To begin, we define _conditional probability_.  This is the probability of one thing happening given that another thing has already occurred.  This is a really common circumstance in geophysics because our data do not make direct observations, we try to infer results based no data that are indirect.  So as in the example in the book, we might ask:\n",
    "1. What is the probability of an eruption, given our observed seismicity near a volcano? \n",
    "2. What is the probability that there is mineralization, given our observed magnetic data?\n",
    "3. What is the probability of a particular mineral being present given the hardness of our sample?\n",

    "$$\n",
    "P(eruption|tremor) > P(eruption)\n",

Because they are independent we multiply them together to find the joint probability.  Now there is nothing special in the choice of $A$ and $B$ and so we have that:\n",

    "1. For most of this to apply, we have to assume that the samples are representative of a random distribution.  This is often not the case (e.g. if you analyze core), but often a reasonable approximation.\n",
    "2. Particularly important for machine learning is to make sure that the samples that you use for training are representative of the underlying distribution that you want to sample.  This is often not trivial.\n",
    "3. Be on the lookout for hidden correlations between your variables.  This can confound your probability/statistics and make your results look better or worse than they really are."
